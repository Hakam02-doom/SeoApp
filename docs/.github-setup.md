# GitHub Setup Instructions

Your code is ready to push to GitHub! Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `seo-app` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: "RankYak SEO Platform - Complete SEO content management system"
   - **Visibility**: Choose Private or Public
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these commands:

```bash
# Add the remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/seo-app.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Or if you prefer SSH:

```bash
# Add the remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/seo-app.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify

After pushing, refresh your GitHub repository page. You should see all your files!

## Important Notes

- **Environment Variables**: Make sure you never commit `.env` files (they're already in `.gitignore`)
- **Secrets**: Never commit API keys, database URLs, or other secrets
- **Database**: You'll need to set up your database separately on your hosting platform
- **Deployment**: Consider using Vercel, Railway, or similar platforms for easy deployment

## Next Steps

1. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD (optional)
2. Add a `.env.example` file with placeholder values
3. Set up branch protection rules
4. Configure GitHub Secrets for deployment
